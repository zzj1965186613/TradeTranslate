## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-08

### Major Feature — Multilingual support + Multiple API providers

**Upgrade from fixed EN?ZH to any language pair, with 5 AI provider options.**

### Phase 1: Multilingual Support

**Languages added:** English, 简体中文, 繁體中文, 日本語, ???, Espa?ol, Fran?ais, Deutsch, Português, Русский, ???????, Ti?ng Vi?t, ???????, Bahasa Indonesia (14 total).

#### content.ts

- Replaced `hasChinese()` and `isEnglish()` with generic script detection functions:
  - `hasCJK()`, `hasLatin()`, `hasCyrillic()`, `hasArabic()`, `hasHiraganaKatakana()`, `hasHangul()`, `hasThai()`
  - `detectScript()` — returns the primary script of text (cjk, latin, japanese, korean, cyrillic, arabic, thai, unknown)
  - `getExpectedScript()` — maps language code to expected script
  - `matchesLanguage()` — checks if text matches the configured source language's script
- `loadSettings()` now reads `sourceLangIncoming`, `targetLangIncoming`, `sourceLangOutgoing`, `targetLangOutgoing` from storage
- `sendTranslate()` signature changed from `direction: "en2zh" | "zh2en"` to `sourceLang: string, targetLang: string`
- Incoming flow: checks `matchesLanguage(text, sourceLangIncoming)` instead of `isEnglish(text)`
- Outgoing flow: checks `matchesLanguage(text, sourceLangOutgoing)` instead of `hasChinese(text)`
- All language settings are reactive via `chrome.storage.onChanged`

#### background.ts

- Replaced hardcoded `PROMPTS` object with `buildPrompt(sourceLang, targetLang)` that dynamically generates translation instructions
- `TranslateRequest` interface changed: `direction` replaced with `sourceLang` and `targetLang`
- `callAPI()` now accepts `sourceLang` and `targetLang` parameters

#### popup.html / popup.ts

- Added language selector dropdowns for incoming direction (From/To) and outgoing direction (From/To)
- All 14 languages available in each dropdown
- Default: Incoming EN→ZH, Outgoing ZH→EN (backward compatible)
- Language settings saved to `chrome.storage.local`

### Phase 2: Multiple API Providers

**Providers supported:** DeepSeek (default), OpenAI, Claude (Anthropic), Google Gemini, Custom (OpenAI-compatible).

#### background.ts

- Added provider abstraction layer with three API call functions:
  - `callOpenAICompatible()` — handles DeepSeek, OpenAI, and custom OpenAI-compatible APIs (shared `Authorization: Bearer` header format)
  - `callClaude()` — Anthropic Messages API with `x-api-key` header, `anthropic-version` header, separate `system` field, and `content[0].text` response format
  - `callGemini()` — Gemini REST API with API key in URL query parameter, merged prompt+user message, and `candidates[0].content.parts[0].text` response format
- `callAPI()` dispatcher routes to the correct provider based on stored settings
- `getSettings()` reads `apiProvider`, `apiKey`, `customBaseUrl`, `customModel` from storage
- `buildPrompt()` generates a translation system prompt from source/target language names
- Unified error handling with human-readable messages (401→"Invalid API key", 429→"Rate limited", 403→"Permission denied")
- `PROVIDER_DEFAULTS` maps each provider to its default base URL and model name

#### popup.html

- Added API Provider dropdown (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Custom) above the API Key input
- Added hidden Custom fields (Base URL, Model Name) that appear when "Custom" is selected
- API Key placeholder updates dynamically per provider (e.g., `sk-ant-...` for Claude, `AIza...` for Gemini)

#### popup.ts

- Added `apiProvider`, `customBaseUrl`, `customModel` DOM refs and storage management
- `updatePlaceholder()` switches API key hint and toggles custom field visibility
- `saveKey()` persists provider, key, and custom fields together

#### manifest.json

- Added `host_permissions` for `api.openai.com`, `api.anthropic.com`, and `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`

### Backward Compatibility

- If no `apiProvider` is stored, defaults to `"deepseek"` — existing users see no change
- If no language settings are stored, defaults to Incoming EN→ZH / Outgoing ZH→EN
- `content.ts` is unchanged — it only calls `sendTranslate(text, sourceLang, targetLang)` and doesn't know which provider is used

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-08

### Feature — Auto-fetch model list from API providers

**New:** Users no longer need to manually type model names. After entering an API key and clicking refresh, the extension automatically fetches available models from the API and populates a dropdown.

### What Changed

**popup.html:**
- Replaced custom provider "Model Name" text input with a `<select>` dropdown + refresh button.
- Added a "Model" dropdown with refresh button for all preset providers (DeepSeek / OpenAI / Claude / Gemini).
- Two dropdowns: `#modelSelect` for presets, `#customModel` for custom — never shown simultaneously.

**popup.ts:**
- `fetchModelsForCurrentProvider()` — sends `fetchModels` action to background, populates the appropriate dropdown.
- Auto-fetches models on popup open if API key is already saved.
- Restores previously selected model after fetch.
- "Manual input..." option at end of dropdown — prompts user for custom model name.
- Saves selected model to `chrome.storage.local` on Save.

**background.ts:**
- `fetchModels()` dispatcher — routes to correct API by provider.
- `fetchModelsOpenAI()` — GET `/models` with Bearer auth (used by DeepSeek, OpenAI, Custom).
- `fetchModelsGemini()` — GET `v1beta/models?key=`, filters for `generateContent` support.
- `CLAUDE_MODELS` — hardcoded list (Anthropic has no public model list API).
- `deriveModelsUrl()` — strips `/chat/completions` suffix from custom base URLs.
- Message listener now handles both `fetchModels` and translate actions.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-06-07

### Bug Fix — Use InputEvent beforeinput for Lexical editor compatibility

**Severity:** Critical — all previous text replacement methods failed with Lexical editor.

### Root Cause

Testing confirmed that Lexical editor only reliably responds to `InputEvent("beforeinput")` events. Previous approaches (`execCommand`, `ClipboardEvent paste`, direct DOM manipulation) either didn't update Lexical's internal state or had async timing issues that caused false verification failures, leading to multiple fallback attempts that appended text instead of replacing it.

User console test showed:
- `beforeinput deleteContentBackward` → successfully clears Lexical state
- `beforeinput insertText` → successfully inserts into Lexical state
- All methods are processed **asynchronously** by Lexical (innerText check immediately after returns empty)

### What Changed

- `setInputText()`: Completely rewritten to use only `InputEvent("beforeinput")` with `deleteContentBackward` + `insertText`. Removed all fallback methods that caused the append bug. Removed synchronous verification (Lexical is async).
- `handleOutgoingTranslation()`: Removed synchronous text verification. Increased post-replacement wait from 200ms to 300ms for Lexical async processing.
- Post-translation Enter/click delay: Increased from 150ms to 500ms to ensure Lexical fully processes the text change before sending.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-06-07

### Bug Fix — Translated text appended instead of replacing; debug logs not visible

**Severity:** Critical — outgoing message contains both Chinese original and English translation concatenated.

### Root Cause

1. **Text append instead of replace:** `document.execCommand("insertText")` was called after `execCommand("selectAll")`, but Lexical editor maintains its own internal selection state separate from the DOM Selection API. The `selectAll` changed the DOM selection, but Lexical's internal cursor was still at the end of the text, so `insertText` appended the translation after the original Chinese text instead of replacing it.

2. **Debug logs not visible:** `ttLog()` used `console.debug()` which is filtered out by default in Chrome DevTools. Users had to enable "Verbose" log level to see them.

### What Changed

- `setInputText()`: Now uses a **clear-then-insert** strategy: first `execCommand("selectAll")` + `execCommand("delete")` to clear the input, then `execCommand("insertText")` to insert the translation. This ensures the input is empty before inserting, avoiding the append bug.
- `ttLog()`: Changed from `console.debug()` to `console.log()` so logs appear in the default Console view.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-06-07

### Bug Fix — Translation replaces text but WhatsApp sends original Chinese

**Severity:** Critical — outgoing translation appears to work but WhatsApp sends the original Chinese text.

### Root Cause

WhatsApp uses a Lexical rich-text editor for the compose input. The previous `setInputText()` used `document.execCommand("insertText")` which is deprecated and does not trigger Lexical's input handling. While the visible DOM text was replaced, Lexical's internal state still held the original Chinese text. When `fireEnterOn()` dispatched Enter, Lexical sent its internal state (Chinese) rather than the visible DOM text.

### What Changed

- `setInputText()`: Now tries 4 methods in sequence:
  1. `document.execCommand("insertText")` — works for non-Lexical editors
  2. `ClipboardEvent("paste")` — Lexical natively handles paste events
  3. `InputEvent("beforeinput")` — simulates real keyboard input
  4. Direct DOM update — last resort, updates visible text
  Returns `boolean` indicating success.
- `handleOutgoingTranslation()`: Now waits 200ms (was 100ms) after text replacement and verifies the input actually contains the translated text before returning success.
- Console logs now show which method succeeded and whether replacement was verified.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-06-07

### Bug Fix — Long Chinese text not translated; translation delay; double-send risk

**Severity:** High — outgoing translation fails for longer messages like "这是一条测试消息".

### Root Cause

1. **Long text translation timeout:** DeepSeek API response time scales with text length. Short text ("成功") translates in <1s, but longer text ("这是一条测试消息") can take 2-3s. The Enter key handler had no explicit timeout — if the API was slow, `isProcessingSend` would reset prematurely (150ms in `finally`), allowing a second Enter to bypass interception and send the original Chinese text.

2. **Double-send race condition:** If the user pressed Enter while translation was in progress, the `isProcessingSend` flag could already be reset by the `finally` block, causing the raw Chinese to be sent instead of waiting for the translation.

3. **Pre-cache debounce too short:** `DEBOUNCE_MS = 600` meant the pre-translation cache often captured incomplete text during fast typing, so pressing Enter would miss the cache and make a fresh (slow) API call.

### What Changed

- `DEBOUNCE_MS`: 600 → 1000ms — longer debounce ensures the pre-cache captures the complete text after user stops typing.
- `handleOutgoingTranslation()`: Added 15s explicit timeout via `Promise.race()`. If API exceeds timeout, original text is sent as fallback. `finally` block delay increased from 150ms to 500ms to prevent premature reset.
- Enter key handler: When `isProcessingSend` is true, all subsequent Enter presses are now blocked (prevented from reaching WhatsApp) instead of silently passing through. This eliminates the double-send race condition.
- Send button handler: Same blocking behavior applied for consistency.
- `sendTranslate()`: Wrapped in try-catch to handle edge cases where `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` throws synchronously.

### User Experience Improvement

- Short text ("成功"): Pre-cached during typing → Enter → instant send (0ms API wait).
- Long text ("这是一条测试消息"): Enter → shows blocked Enter attempts in console → waits for API → replaces text → sends English version.
- If API fails or times out: Original Chinese text is sent as-is (graceful degradation).

## [1.0.3] - 2026-06-07

### Bug Fix — Incoming messages without tail not translated + Send button selector + Translation styling

**Severity:** High — most incoming messages in a consecutive group were silently skipped.

### Root Cause

1. **Messages without tail skipped:** WhatsApp only renders `data-testid="tail-in"` / `data-testid="tail-out"` on the **last message in a consecutive group** from the same sender. Earlier messages in the group have no tail indicator, causing `isIncomingMessage()` to return `false`. This meant ~60% of incoming messages were never translated.

2. **Send button not found:** WhatsApp removed `data-testid="send"` from the send button. The button now only has `aria-label="发送"` (or "Send" in English locales), with a child span containing `data-testid="wds-ic-send-filled"`.

3. **Translation text unstyled:** The `.tt-translation` class had no CSS, and no CSS file was injected. Translation text appeared as unstyled default text, indistinguishable from the original message.

### What Changed

- `isIncomingMessage()`: Added `alignItems` fallback — checks the parent container's computed `align-items` CSS property. WhatsApp uses `flex-start` for incoming (left-aligned) and `flex-end` for outgoing (right-aligned). This reliably identifies message direction even without tail indicators.
- `findSendButton()`: Reordered selector priority — `aria-label="发送"` is now primary (since it's always present), with `data-testid="send"` as legacy fallback.
- `appendTranslation()`: Added inline styles to the translation div for visual distinction (gray color, smaller font, top border separator).

### Verification

- In-app browser E2E test: all 12 messages correctly classified (4 incoming, 8 outgoing).
- Previously 6 messages were "unknown" (no tail); now all correctly identified via alignItems.
- "Just a test" and "ok" (incoming English) correctly flagged for translation.
- Send button found via `aria-label="发送"`.
- `npm run build` passes.


## [1.0.2] - 2026-06-07

### Bug Fix — Page crash on Chinese input + incoming translation not working

**Severity:** High — page freezes when typing Chinese; incoming English messages not translated.

### Root Cause

1. **Page crash (Chinese input):** The setupOutgoingHandler() was called repeatedly by
   ebindAll() (every 1s during SPA bootstrap). Even though data-tt-bound was checked,
   when WhatsApp rebuilds the input element on chat switch, the old element is GC'd but
   the flag is lost. With the old approach, the same input could get multiple keydown
   handlers bound via stopImmediatePropagation race conditions, causing infinite loops.

2. **Incoming not translating:** isEnglishDominant() required latinChars > cjkChars,
   which fails for simple messages like "hello" (only 5 latin chars, 0 CJK — the ratio
   check cjkChars / text.length divides by zero-ish). The function was replaced with a
   simpler isEnglish() check: has Latin letters AND has no CJK.

### What Changed

- Replaced data-tt-bound attribute check with WeakSet<HTMLElement> (oundInputs)
  for input deduplication. WeakSet automatically cleans up when DOM elements are GC'd,
  preventing stale binding state across SPA navigation.
- Added isEnglish() helper — simple has Latin && no CJK check instead of ratio-based
  isEnglishDominant() for incoming message detection.
- Added isProcessed() helper that checks both the element and its ancestors for
  data-tt-done to avoid re-processing nested elements.
- Added deduplication (seen Set) in processNewNodes() to avoid processing the same
  element multiple times from overlapping mutations.
- Increased ireEnterOn delay from 50ms to 80ms for more reliable WhatsApp processing.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-07

### Bug Fix — WhatsApp Web DOM selectors updated

**Severity:** High — core translation features were completely non-functional.

### Root Cause

WhatsApp Web updated its DOM structure. The old selectors used by the content script
(span.selectable-text, .message-in, .message-out, #main footer, etc.) no longer
match the current page, causing both incoming (EN→ZH) and outgoing (ZH→EN) translations
to silently fail.

### What Changed

Only src/content.ts was modified. ackground.ts, popup.ts, manifest.json, and
package.json are unchanged.

| Function | Old Selector | New Selector |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| getMessageTextEls() | span.selectable-text | [data-testid="selectable-text"], span.selectable-text |
| isIncomingMessage() | .message-in / .message-out class check | [data-testid="tail-in"] / [data-testid="tail-out"] inside [data-testid="msg-container"] |
| ppendTranslation() | copyableParent.parentElement | Same parent chain, adjusted for new nesting depth |
| indChatInput() | #main div[contenteditable="true"][role="textbox"] | [data-testid="conversation-compose-box-input"] (primary) |
| indSendButton() | utton[aria-label="Send"] | [data-testid="send"] (primary) |
| setupMessageObserver() | #main | [data-testid="conversation-panel-messages"] (primary) |

### Added

- __TT_DEBUG__ flag and 	tLog() helper — gated console.debug logs for future diagnosis.
- Fallback chains on all selectors (new data-testid first, legacy selectors as backup)
  to handle WhatsApp's gradual rollout of DOM changes across users.

### Verification

- 
pm run build passes with no errors.
- Output: dist/content.js (11.06 kB), dist/background.js (2.42 kB), dist/popup.js (1.85 kB).

### How to Test

1. Load unpacked dist/ in Chrome with Developer mode.
2. Set DeepSeek API key in popup, keep both toggles ON.
3. **Outgoing test:** Type Chinese text and press Enter — receiver should see English.
4. **Incoming test:** Send English text from another account — Chinese translation should appear below.
5. Open DevTools Console and look for [TradeTranslate] debug logs.
